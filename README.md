A simple photo gallery Grid with a generic format

I wanted to create something simple to practice using Grids in CSS. 
I created a class with a grid to format a photo grid layout,
I created a class containing all the images and made edits accordingly,
I noticed I created 2 classes when I should have consolidated the properties into one.

Everything will work in VS Code with an Live Server, ensure the CSS file is properly connected.

Thanks!
